# TIE-Fighter Assault

This game uses ARKit to recreate a confrontation against an unlimited number of TIE-Fighters inside an asteroid field.

The asteroids keep appearing at a constant rate and they come directly at your ship. If you destroy them you have a chance to recover some shield or proton torpedoes, a weapon that inflicts double damage than the default laser.
